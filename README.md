Author: Xinming Wang, Yufeng Xing


# Goal

- Boundary detection
- Garbage type classification

Every minute, at least 15 tonnes of plastic waste leak into the ocean. How to reduce and recycle the garbage is a meaningful topic. If we could use deep learning methods to detect and classify garbage in an image, we might be able to clean up the waste more efficiently.


# Dataset

TACO is an open image dataset of waste in the wild. It contains photos of garbage taken in various environments.

Dataset Overview:
- 1500 images
- 4784 annotations
- 60 sub-categories & 28 super-categories
